# CloudWatch Alarm Delivery to Slack using AWS Chatbot

## Overview
This 5-minute demonstration shows how to set up CloudWatch alarms that send notifications to Slack channels using SNS and AWS Chatbot. You'll learn to create an automated alerting system that notifies your team of infrastructure issues in real-time using AWS's native Slack integration.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with CloudWatch and Chatbot permissions
- Slack workspace with admin access to install apps
- Existing CloudWatch metrics to monitor (e.g., EC2 instance)
- Basic understanding of AWS services

## Architecture Overview
```
CloudWatch Alarm → SNS Topic → AWS Chatbot → Slack Channel
```

## Demonstration Steps

### Step 1: Install AWS Chatbot in Slack (1 minute)
1. In your Slack workspace, go to **Apps** → **Browse Apps**
2. Search for **AWS Chatbot** and click on it
3. Click **Add to Slack**
4. Review permissions and click **Allow**
5. You'll be redirected to AWS Chatbot console
6. If not automatically redirected, go to AWS Console → **AWS Chatbot**
7. Note: The AWS Chatbot app is now installed in your Slack workspace

### Step 2: Configure AWS Chatbot for Slack (2 minutes)
1. In AWS Console, navigate to **AWS Chatbot**
2. Click **Configure new client**
3. Select **Slack** as the chat client
4. Click **Configure**
5. You'll be redirected to Slack for authorization
6. Select your Slack workspace and click **Allow**
7. Back in AWS Chatbot console, configure the client:
   - **Configuration name**: `cloudwatch-alerts-slack`
   - **Slack channel**: Select or type `#aws-alerts` (create channel if needed)
   - **Channel type**: Public or Private (based on your preference)
8. **Permissions**:
   - **Channel role**: Create a new role or use existing
   - **Role name**: `ChatbotSlackRole` (if creating new)
   - **Policy templates**: Select **Notification permissions**
9. **SNS topics**: Leave empty for now (we'll add this later)
10. Click **Configure**

### Step 3: Create SNS Topic (30 seconds)
1. Open Amazon SNS Console
2. Click **Create topic**
3. Configure topic:
   - **Type**: Standard
   - **Name**: `cloudwatch-slack-alerts`
   - **Display name**: `CloudWatch Slack Alerts`
4. Click **Create topic**
5. Note the **Topic ARN** for later use

### Step 4: Link SNS Topic to AWS Chatbot (30 seconds)
1. Go back to **AWS Chatbot** console
2. Click on your configured Slack client (`cloudwatch-alerts-slack`)
3. Click **Edit**
4. In the **SNS topics** section, click **Add SNS topic**
5. Select the region where you created your SNS topic
6. Select your `cloudwatch-slack-alerts` topic
7. Click **Save**
8. The SNS topic is now linked to your Slack channel via AWS Chatbot

### Step 5: Create CloudWatch Alarm (1.5 minutes)
1. Open CloudWatch Console
2. Navigate to **Alarms** → **All alarms**
3. Click **Create alarm**
4. **Select metric**:
   - Choose **AWS/EC2** → **Per-Instance Metrics**
   - Select an EC2 instance
   - Choose **CPUUtilization** metric
   - Click **Select metric**

5. **Specify metric and conditions**:
   - **Statistic**: Average
   - **Period**: 5 minutes
   - **Threshold type**: Static
   - **Condition**: Greater than `80` (for demo purposes)
   - Click **Next**

6. **Configure actions**:
   - **Alarm state trigger**: In alarm
   - **SNS topic**: Select `cloudwatch-slack-alerts`
   - Click **Next**

7. **Add name and description**:
   - **Alarm name**: `High-CPU-Usage-Alert`
   - **Description**: `Alert when EC2 CPU usage exceeds 80%`
   - Click **Next**

8. Review and click **Create alarm**

### Step 6: Test the AWS Chatbot Integration (30 seconds)
1. **Option 1 - Modify alarm threshold**:
   - Edit the alarm to use a very low threshold (e.g., 1%)
   - Wait for alarm to trigger

2. **Option 2 - Use AWS CLI to set alarm state**:
```bash
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
    --alarm-name "High-CPU-Usage-Alert" \
    --state-value ALARM \
    --state-reason "Testing AWS Chatbot Slack integration"
```

3. Check your Slack channel for the AWS Chatbot notification
4. The message will include formatted alarm details with AWS branding

## AWS Chatbot Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Notification Format:
AWS Chatbot provides built-in formatting for CloudWatch alarms with:
- Color-coded messages based on alarm state
- Structured information display
- Direct links to AWS Console
- Consistent AWS branding

### Adding Interactive Commands:
AWS Chatbot supports interactive Slack commands:
```
@aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names High-CPU-Usage-Alert
@aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization
@aws support describe-cases --include-resolved-cases
```

### Multiple Slack Channels:
Create separate Chatbot configurations for different teams:
1. **Infrastructure team**: `#infrastructure-alerts`
2. **Database team**: `#database-alerts`  
3. **Security team**: `#security-alerts`

Each configuration can have different:
- SNS topics
- IAM permissions
- Notification preferences

### Guardrails and Permissions:
Configure IAM policies to control what commands users can run:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:Describe*",
                "cloudwatch:Get*",
                "cloudwatch:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Channel Guardrails:
Set up channel-specific permissions:
- **Read-only channels**: Only allow describe and get operations
- **Admin channels**: Allow more privileged operations
- **Emergency channels**: Full access for incident response

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:

1. **AWS Chatbot not receiving notifications**:
   - Verify SNS topic is correctly linked to Chatbot configuration
   - Check that CloudWatch alarm is using the correct SNS topic ARN
   - Ensure Chatbot has proper IAM permissions

2. **Slack app not installed properly**:
   - Verify AWS Chatbot app is installed in your Slack workspace
   - Check that the app has permission to post in the target channel
   - Ensure channel exists and Chatbot is invited to private channels

3. **Permission issues**:
   - Verify Chatbot IAM role has necessary permissions
   - Check that SNS topic policy allows Chatbot to subscribe
   - Ensure CloudWatch has permission to publish to SNS

4. **Messages not appearing in Slack**:
   - Check if channel is private and Chatbot needs to be invited
   - Verify Slack workspace authorization is still valid
   - Look for error messages in AWS Chatbot console

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Test SNS topic directly
aws sns publish \
    --topic-arn "arn:aws:sns:region:account:cloudwatch-slack-alerts" \
    --message "Test message from SNS"

# Check Chatbot configurations
aws chatbot describe-slack-channel-configurations

# Test alarm state change
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state \
    --alarm-name "High-CPU-Usage-Alert" \
    --state-value ALARM \
    --state-reason "Manual test"
```

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check Chatbot configuration**: Ensure SNS topic is properly linked
2. **Test SNS publishing**: Verify messages reach the topic
3. **Verify Slack permissions**: Ensure app can post to channel
4. **Check alarm configuration**: Confirm SNS topic ARN is correct

## Key Learning Points
- AWS Chatbot provides native Slack integration without custom code
- SNS acts as the bridge between CloudWatch alarms and Chatbot
- Chatbot offers built-in formatting and interactive capabilities
- IAM roles control what commands users can execute via Slack
- Multiple configurations enable team-specific notification routing

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- Use descriptive alarm names and descriptions for clear notifications
- Configure appropriate IAM permissions for security
- Set up separate Chatbot configurations for different teams
- Use channel guardrails to control command permissions
- Test integrations thoroughly before relying on them for production alerts

## AWS Chatbot Benefits
- **No custom code required**: Fully managed service
- **Interactive commands**: Run AWS CLI commands from Slack
- **Built-in formatting**: Professional alarm notifications
