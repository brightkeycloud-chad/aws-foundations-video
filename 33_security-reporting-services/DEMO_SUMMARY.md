- `create-eventbridge-rule.sh` - Quick setup automation
- `generate-sample-findings.sh` - Sample findings generator

## Prerequisites

### Common Requirements
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured (for automated scripts)
- Basic understanding of AWS security services

### Service-Specific Requirements
- **Security Hub**: AWS Config enabled (recommended)
