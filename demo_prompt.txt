In this directory are subdirectories that will be used to give AWS demonstrations. The subdirectory name has the demo title as well as the tools used, such as console, terminal, sdk, cli, etc.
For each subdirectory, do the following:
Create a demonstration using the title that will take five minutes to deliver.
Create a markdown readme document containing instructions for executing the demonstration, using current AWS documentation.
Add citations in the readme with link(s) for documentation used to generate the instructions.
If the demonstration uses code to provision resources, create a cleanup script to be executed after the demonstration is complete, ensuring the cleanup script does not require the user to enter any information.
If the demonstration requires code to be copied and pasted, create simple scripts to perform these actions, unless the code is to be pasted into the AWS console.
