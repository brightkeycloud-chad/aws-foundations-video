## Instructor Preparation

### Before Each Demo
1. Review the README.md for comprehensive background
2. Practice with the demo-script.md for timing and flow
3. Have the quick-reference.md available for troubleshooting
4. Set up the prerequisite infrastructure
5. Test the demonstration end-to-end

### Demo Environment Setup
- Ensure all prerequisites are met
- Have backup configurations ready
- Test network connectivity beforehand
- Prepare architecture diagrams
- Have AWS Console bookmarks ready

## Customization Options

### Time Adjustments
- Extend to 10 minutes for more detailed explanations
- Compress to 3 minutes for overview-only presentations
- Add advanced topics for technical audiences

### Audience Adaptations
- **Beginners**: Focus on concepts and basic configuration
- **Intermediate**: Include troubleshooting and best practices
- **Advanced**: Add custom routing and integration scenarios

### Environment Variations
- **Multi-account**: Show cross-account peering/sharing
- **Multi-region**: Demonstrate cross-region connectivity
- **Hybrid**: Include on-premises integration scenarios
