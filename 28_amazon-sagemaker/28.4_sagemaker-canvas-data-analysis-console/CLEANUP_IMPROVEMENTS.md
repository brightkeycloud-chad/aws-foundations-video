# Canvas Cleanup Script Improvements

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ❌ Previous Issues:
- Manual domain ID entry required
- Commands that would error if resources didn't exist
- No automatic detection of QuickSetupDomain- domains
- Static commands that needed manual editing
- No verification of Canvas application status

### ✅ New Features:

## 🤖 Automated Resource Detection
- **Automatic Domain Discovery**: Finds QuickSetupDomain- domains automatically
- **Canvas App Detection**: Identifies running Canvas applications
- **Smart Resource Checking**: Verifies what resources actually exist before attempting operations

## 🛠️ Dynamic Command Generation
- **Auto-populated Commands**: All commands include actual domain IDs and resource names
- **Context-Aware Instructions**: Shows specific domain names and IDs in guidance
- **Working Verification Commands**: All provided commands are tested and functional

## 🔍 Enhanced Error Handling
- **AWS CLI Validation**: Checks if AWS CLI is configured before proceeding
- **Resource Existence Checks**: Verifies resources exist before attempting operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works with or without `jq` installed
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides helpful feedback when issues occur

## 📊 Improved Feedback
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current state of Canvas applications
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback during cleanup operations
- **Verification Steps**: Provides commands to confirm cleanup completion
- **Cost Impact Guidance**: Explains billing implications of each action

## 🎯 Automated Actions

### Canvas Application Management:
```bash
# Automatically stops running Canvas apps
stop_canvas_apps "$domain_id" "$domain_name"
```

### Dynamic Command Generation:
```bash
# Example of auto-generated verification command:
aws sagemaker list-apps --domain-id-equals d-pusn4aomkzxh --region us-east-1 --query 'Apps[?AppType==`Canvas`].[AppName,Status,UserProfileName]' --output table
```

### Smart Resource Detection:
```bash
# Finds QuickSetupDomain- domains automatically
QUICKSETUP_DOMAINS=$(get_quicksetup_domains)
```

## 📋 New Script Workflow

1. **🔍 Discovery Phase**:
   - Checks AWS CLI configuration
   - Lists all SageMaker domains
   - Identifies QuickSetupDomain- domains specifically

2. **🛑 Application Management**:
   - Automatically stops running Canvas applications
   - Provides real-time feedback on stopping progress
   - Verifies applications are fully stopped

3. **📋 Guidance Generation**:
   - Creates domain-specific cleanup instructions
   - Generates working CLI commands with actual resource IDs
   - Provides verification commands for each step

4. **✅ Verification**:
   - Offers multiple verification commands
   - Checks for related S3 buckets
   - Monitors recent training jobs
   - Confirms Canvas applications are stopped

## 🎯 Key Improvements Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Domain Detection | Manual entry required | Automatic QuickSetupDomain- detection |
| Command Generation | Static placeholders | Dynamic with actual resource IDs |
| Error Handling | Commands could fail | Robust error checking |
| Canvas App Management | Manual only | Automated stopping |
| Verification | Generic commands | Specific, working commands |
| User Experience | Required manual editing | Fully automated guidance |

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Before (Manual):
```bash
# User had to manually find and enter domain ID
aws sagemaker list-apps --domain-id-equals DOMAIN_ID --region us-east-1
```

### After (Automated):
```bash
# Script automatically generates working commands:
aws sagemaker list-apps --domain-id-equals d-pusn4aomkzxh --region us-east-1 --query 'Apps[?AppType==`Canvas`].[AppName,Status,UserProfileName]' --output table
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Integration with Main Cleanup**: The Canvas cleanup script now seamlessly integrates with the main Studio cleanup script
2. **Cost Awareness**: Provides specific guidance on cost implications of each cleanup action
3. **Verification Focus**: Emphasizes verification steps to ensure complete cleanup
4. **Fallback Support**: Works even without advanced tools like `jq` installed

The updated Canvas cleanup script transforms from a static guidance document into an intelligent, automated cleanup tool that adapts to your specific AWS environment.
