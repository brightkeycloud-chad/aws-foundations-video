# Cleanup Scripts Summary

## ✅ Created Cleanup Scripts

I've created comprehensive cleanup scripts to remove all resources created during the Lambda demonstration:

### 1. **quick_cleanup.sh** (Recommended)
- **Purpose**: Fast, simple cleanup using AWS CLI
- **Usage**: `./quick_cleanup.sh`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ No user interaction required
  - ✅ Uses only AWS CLI commands
  - ✅ Removes Lambda function, IAM role, CloudWatch logs
  - ✅ Cleans up local files (venv, __pycache__)
  - ✅ Graceful handling of missing resources

### 2. **cleanup.py** + **cleanup.sh** (Advanced)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive cleanup with resource discovery
- **Usage**: `./cleanup.sh`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Interactive prompts for safety
  - ✅ Scans for additional related resources
  - ✅ Detailed progress reporting
  - ✅ Uses boto3 Python SDK
  - ✅ Handles virtual environment setup

## ✅ Tested and Validated

Both cleanup scripts have been tested and work correctly:

```bash
# Test results from quick_cleanup.sh:
✅ AWS CLI configured
🔐 AWS Account: 997075698610
✅ CloudWatch log group deleted: /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction
✅ Removed virtual environment
✅ Removed Python cache
🎉 Quick cleanup completed!
```

## ✅ Resources Cleaned Up

### AWS Resources:
- **Lambda Function**: `myLambdaFunction`
- **IAM Role**: `myLambdaFunction-role` (with policy detachment)
- **CloudWatch Log Group**: `/aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction`

### Local Files:
- **Virtual Environment**: `venv/` directory
- **Python Cache**: `__pycache__/` directory

## ✅ Safety Features

- Only removes specifically named demonstration resources
- Graceful handling when resources don't exist
- Clear status messages for each operation
- No risk of deleting other AWS resources
- Requires AWS CLI configuration validation

## ✅ Usage Recommendations

### After Demonstration:
```bash
./quick_cleanup.sh
```

### After Testing:
```bash
./cleanup.sh  # For thorough cleanup with resource discovery
```

### For Automation:
```bash
./run_test.sh && ./quick_cleanup.sh  # Test then cleanup
```

## ✅ Documentation

- **CLEANUP_README.md** - Comprehensive cleanup documentation
- **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - This summary file
- Scripts include built-in help and status messages

The cleanup scripts ensure that no demonstration resources are left behind in your AWS account, preventing any ongoing charges and maintaining account cleanliness.
