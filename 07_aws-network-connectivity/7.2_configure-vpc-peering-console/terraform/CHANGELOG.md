# Terraform Configuration Changelog

## VPC Endpoints Removal (Latest)

### Changes Made
- **Removed VPC Endpoints**: Eliminated all SSM-related VPC endpoints (ssm, ssmmessages, ec2messages)
- **Removed VPC Endpoint Security Groups**: Cleaned up associated security groups
- **Updated Cost Model**: Reduced monthly cost from ~$133 to ~$90 by removing 6 VPC endpoints
- **Simplified Architecture**: EC2 instances now use NAT Gateway for internet access and SSM connectivity

### What Still Works
- ✅ **SSM Session Manager**: Full functionality via NAT Gateway
- ✅ **IAM Roles**: EC2 instances still have proper SSM permissions
- ✅ **Private Subnet Placement**: Instances remain secure in private subnets
- ✅ **All Demo Functionality**: VPC peering demo works exactly the same

### Benefits
- **Cost Reduction**: Save ~$43/month by removing VPC endpoints
- **Simplified Setup**: Fewer resources to manage and troubleshoot
- **Standard Architecture**: Uses common NAT Gateway pattern for internet access
- **Same Security**: Instances still in private subnets with IAM-based access

### Files Modified
- `main.tf`: Removed VPC endpoints and their security groups
- `outputs.tf`: Removed VPC endpoint outputs
- `README.md`: Updated documentation to reflect NAT Gateway usage
- `user_data.sh`: Updated instance info to mention NAT Gateway
- `verify.sh`: Added NAT Gateway checks, removed VPC endpoint checks
- `test-ssm.sh`: Updated troubleshooting steps

### Migration Notes
If you have existing infrastructure with VPC endpoints:
1. The next `terraform apply` will destroy the VPC endpoints
2. There may be a brief interruption in SSM connectivity during the transition
3. Instances will automatically reconnect via NAT Gateway
4. No manual intervention required

### Cost Comparison
| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| NAT Gateways | $90/month | $90/month |
| VPC Endpoints | $43/month | $0/month |
| **Total** | **$133/month** | **$90/month** |

### Architecture Change
```
Before: EC2 → VPC Endpoints → SSM Service
After:  EC2 → NAT Gateway → Internet → SSM Service
```

Both approaches provide the same functionality, but the NAT Gateway approach is more cost-effective for this demonstration use case.
